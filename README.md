<b>Timeworm Flux</b></p>

#### Explanation
Flux is the stage that prepares code before it's sent to be compiled with LLVM. This stage includes the pre-LLVM "time-travel" optimizations, but the primary parts of this codebase are for memory safety using static analysis.

#### Credits
This codebase was mostly created by [Earl Dish](https://github.com/xmm16).
